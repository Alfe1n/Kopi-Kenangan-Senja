# Kopi Kenangan Senja

**Kopi Kenangan Senja** is my first web development project. In this project, I built a simple responsive website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website is designed to showcase a responsive navigation bar, which adapts well on various devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website layout adjusts based on the screen size (laptop, tablet, mobile).
- **Simple and Clean UI:** I aimed to create an intuitive, user-friendly interface with a minimalist design.
- **Interactive Elements:** JavaScript is used to add interactivity, such as dynamic content changes and smooth navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS:** For styling and layout. I used Flexbox and Media Queries to make the design responsive.
- **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and smooth user experience enhancements.
